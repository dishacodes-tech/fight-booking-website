# ✈️ Flight Booking Website

This is a professional flight booking landing page built using pure **HTML** and **CSS**.  
It’s designed to look like a real-world airline or travel startup website — inspired by platforms like IndiGo, AirIndia, and Skyscanner.  
Built completely from scratch with a focus on **clean UI, responsive layout, and realistic booking flow**.
